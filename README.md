# Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social and communication skills, and idiosyncratic and repetitiveness in behaviors. Current effective treatments for ASD included behavioral therapies like Applied Behavioral Therapy, Pivotal Response Therapy, etc. However, these treatments are limited due to scarcity of trained professionals and cost- and time-intensive nature of these treatments. There is a need for new automated and cost-efficient treatment for ASD to overcome these limitations. Research studies show that autistic children between the ages of 5 to 16 have deficiency in working memory compared to their neurotypical peers. Working memory is necessary for daily routine activities. We have developed a suite of games to provide working memory training to autistic children between the ages of 5 to 16. These games are better compared to the available games because we have tested these games repeatedly on autistic children during the development of the games. Since autistic children have difficulties in understanding verbal/textual instructions, our games are specifically designed such that they are intuitive for these children. We have incorporated the behavioral and sensory preferences of these special children in our games to incentivize the game play. Many autistic children have problems in using applications that require fine motor movements. Our games are designed to use only single “Tap” on the screen, which these kids are able to perform well.


# Games

1. Basket Games: The objective of the game is to capture colored fruits into the basket with same color as that of the fruit. The game has an introductory level in which only one basket is used to let children practice capturing fruit inside the basket. With increase in levels, number of baskets is increased. 

2. Face Game: The objective of the game is to complete an empty face so that it matches with a model face shown at the start of the level and hidden after some delay. The child is presented 3 options for each of the different features of the face like hair, eyes etc to choose from such that it matches with the model face. To increase the difficulty, more details are added to the face with complex facial expressions. 

3. Piano Game: The objective of the game is to repeat a sequence of notes to complete a tune. With increase in levels, the length of the sequence is also increased. 

5. Shape Game: This game contains simple objects of different shapes. The objective of the game is to match the objects of same shape. With increase in levels, the number of shapes is increased and their position is shuffled after a predefined number of trials. 

4. Train Game: The objective of the game is to attach carts that have specifics shapes on its both ends and only carts with complementary shapes can attach to each other. The game has an introductory level to practice matching complementary shapes.
